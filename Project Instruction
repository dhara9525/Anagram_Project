An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse.


Take an input file (e.g. words.txt) with words that are separated on new lines. Run them through a program that will print the group of words that are anagrams. Goal is to be able to process this relatively quickly.


Example Input File:

==============

pop

top

yard

bird

star

sore

rose

pot


Example Output (words can be in any order but they must be grouped by their matching anagrams):

=============

top, pot

sore, rose
